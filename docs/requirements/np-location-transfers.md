- **Transfer Labels**: Labels for motherboards transferred to SB
- **Internal Organization**: Labels for NP internal organization and tracking

### Inter-Location Transfer System

**Transfer Creation (SB â†’ NP):**
- **Authorized Users**: Authorized SB users create "Transfer to NP" records
- **Transfer Information**:
  - Parts and quantities being transferred
  - SB CTs if any are assigned
  - Transfer reason (e.g., specialized QC, motherboard testing)
  - Special instructions or requirements
- **Transfer Documentation**: System generates transfer records for audit

**Transfer Creation (NP â†’ SB):**
- **Authorized Users**: Authorized NP users create "Transfer to SB" records
- **Transfer Information**:
  - Processed parts and quantities
  - NP CTs assigned during processing
  - Test results and QC status
  - Any issues or special handling requirements

**Transfer Slip Generation:**
- **Printable Transfer Slip**: System generates basic printable transfer slip for each transfer
- **Transfer Details**: Include all relevant transfer information
