**Phase 2: Meta WhatsApp Cloud API Integration**
- Direct Meta Cloud API implementation (no third-party fees)
- Interactive button support for workflow approvals
- Rich media messaging (documents, images, voice)
- Template message management with approval workflow
- Webhook handler for button responses

**Phase 3: Interactive Approval Workflows**
- CT duplicate approval with ✅ Approve/❌ Reject buttons
- QC rejection approval with interactive responses
- Part mapping approval with image context
- Transfer authorization with quantity confirmation
- Real-time workflow responses via buttons

**Phase 4: Unified Messaging System**
- Provider abstraction layer for seamless switching
- Intelligent fallback (Official API → N8N → Manual)
- Cost tracking and performance monitoring
- Message analytics and delivery reports

**Phase 5: Advanced Business Features**

interface WhatsAppProviderConfig {
  provider: WhatsAppProvider
  metaConfig?: MetaCloudAPIConfig
  n8nConfig?: N8NEvolutionAPIConfig
  fallbackProvider?: WhatsAppProvider
}
```

**Environment Variables**:
