## Core Requirements

### Progressive Quantity Tracking System Overview

**Fundamental Concept:**
- **Real-time Quantity Tracking**: Detailed, real-time view of unit quantities across all operational stages
- **Progressive System**: Quantities flow through defined states from order to delivery
- **quantityLogs Array**: Comprehensive audit trail per order line for all quantity movements
- **Denormalized Current State**: order_line_quantities table for fast current state queries
- **Traceability**: All movements must be traceable with user, timestamp, and reason

### SB Order Line States (Complete Progressive System)

**Primary Quantity States:**
1. **TotalOrderQuantity** - Total quantity ordered by customer
2. **PendingProcurementArrangement** - Awaiting procurement action or parts sourcing
3. **RequestedFromStock** - Requested from existing inventory
4. **AwaitingKittingPacking** - Parts available, waiting for kitting/packing assignment
5. **InKittingPacking** - Currently being kitted/packed by SB staff
6. **OnHoldAtKittingPacking** - On hold during kitting/packing stage
7. **KittedPacked_AwaitingScreeningQC** - Completed kitting/packing, ready for QC
8. **InScreeningQC** - Currently undergoing screening/QC process
9. **OnHoldAtScreeningQC** - On hold during screening/QC stage
10. **ScreeningQCPassed_ReadyForInvoice** - Passed QC, ready for invoicing
11. **ScreeningQCRejected** - Failed QC, returns to PendingProcurementArrangement
12. **Invoiced** - Included in customer invoice
13. **ShippedDelivered** - Shipped to customer and delivered
14. **CustomerReturned** - Returned by customer (placeholder for future)
15. **Cancelled** - Order line cancelled

**State Transition Rules:**
- **Forward Progression**: Generally moves forward through states
- **Rejection Returns**: ScreeningQCRejected returns to PendingProcurementArrangement
- **Hold States**: Parts can be held at Kitting/Packing or Screening/QC stages
- **Skip States**: Some states may be skipped based on workflow (e.g., direct from stock)

### Quantity Logs System (quantityLogs)

**Required Log Entry Fields:**
- **action_type**: Type of quantity movement (e.g., "moved_to_kitting", "qc_passed", "placed_on_hold")
- **quantity_moved**: Number of units involved in this movement
- **from_state**: Previous quantity state (null for initial entry)
- **to_state**: New quantity state after movement
- **timestamp**: Precise date/time of movement
- **user_id**: User who performed the action
- **reason_text**: Business reason for the movement (mandatory for holds/rejects)
- **associated_ct_numbers**: Array of CT numbers involved in this movement
- **metadata**: Additional context (location, equipment, batch number, etc.)

**Log Entry Examples:**
```json
{
  "action_type": "moved_to_kitting",
  "quantity_moved": 5,
  "from_state": "AwaitingKittingPacking",
  "to_state": "InKittingPacking",
  "timestamp": "2025-01-07T14:30:00Z",
  "user_id": "user_sb_kitting_01",
  "reason_text": "Assigned to John for afternoon kitting batch",
  "associated_ct_numbers": ["CT001", "CT002", "CT003", "CT004", "CT005"],
  "metadata": {
    "workstation": "Kitting_Station_A",
    "batch_id": "BATCH_070125_A"
  }
}
```

### Visual Quantity Display on Order Cards

**Order Card Quantity Visualization:**

- **Real-time Updates**: Update immediately when quantities change
- **Customer-Specific**: Calculate separately for each customer
