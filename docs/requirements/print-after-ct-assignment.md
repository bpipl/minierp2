## Core Requirements

### Immediate Print Trigger
- **Primary Trigger**: After CT assignment is saved in the CT Number Modal, user should have immediate printing option
- **User Request Context**: "yes i need immediate printing option after assign should save along with that"
- **Critical Integration**: Must save CT assignments AND provide immediate printing without separate workflows

### Label Printing System Integration
From Phase 5 requirements - this functionality bridges CT assignment with the comprehensive label system:

**Integrated Label Design Canvas Requirements:**
- Embed feature-rich, open-source JavaScript label design canvas
- **Toolset Requirements**: 
  - Add/edit static/dynamic text (font, size, style)
  - Lines, rectangles, circles
  - **Critical**: Various barcodes (Code 128, Code 39, QR essential)
  - Barcode data linkable to dynamic fields
  - Static images (logos)

**Dynamic Data Field Integration for CT Labels:**
- Easy selection/placement of app data fields onto label
- **Available Fields**: UID, Part No, BPI DSC, Qty, **CT No**, PO No, Dates, etc.
- User-defined custom label sizes (width/height in mm/inches)
- Canvas reflects actual size
- **WYSIWYG preview** - crucial for immediate print verification

### CT-Specific Label Requirements

**CT Label Template Management:**
- Save/load label designs as named templates
- **Admin Control**: Admin can designate defaults per customer, part category, purpose
- **Critical Default**: "Default CT Label" template must exist
- Global template system for immediate use

**ZPL Generation & Output for CT Labels:**
- Converts visual design (with dynamic CT data) to ZPL/ZPL II
- **Admin/Developer Option**: View/copy raw ZPL (for Labelary testing)
- **File Download**: Option to download .zpl file
- **Real-time Generation**: Must work with live CT data immediately after assignment

### Network Printer Integration (Critical for Immediate Print)

**Local NPS (Network Print Server) Integration:**
- Web app sends print jobs (ZPL + target printer) via HTTP POST to generic NPS application on local network
- NPS forwards ZPL to selected local Zebra printer
- **Environment Variable**: VITE_NPS_URL=(to be configured for label printing)

**Admin Printer Settings Requirements:**
- Configure NPS URL(s) in admin settings
- Add/edit/remove network Zebra printers (Name, IP, Port)
- View basic printer status (if NPS provides it)
- **Multi-printer Support**: Support multiple printers with user selection
- **Default Assignment**: Default printer assignable per label template

**User Print Experience for CT Assignment:**
- User selects target Zebra printer at print time
- Default printer pre-selected if configured for CT label template
- **Immediate Feedback**: Print job status and confirmation

### Quick Print Integration for CT Labels

**Generic CT Label Quick Print:**
- **Template Selection**: Dedicated menu access to CT label templates
- **Quick Workflow**: User selects template, quantity (for multiple CT labels), printer, and prints
- **CT Data Integration**: Must pull live CT data from just-assigned CT numbers
- **No Manual Data Entry**: Fully automated data population from CT assignment context

### Technical Specifications

**CT Assignment Modal Enhancement:**
- After successful CT save operation, show "Print Labels" button/section
- **Template Selection**: Dropdown of available CT label templates
- **Printer Selection**: Dropdown of configured Zebra printers
- **Quantity Selection**: Number input for label quantity (default: number of CTs assigned)
- **Preview Option**: Show label preview with actual CT data before printing

**Data Flow for Immediate Print:**
1. User assigns CT numbers in CT Modal
2. CT numbers saved to database (existing functionality)
3. **New**: Print section becomes available with CT data pre-populated
4. User selects template and printer
5. System generates ZPL with real CT data
6. System sends print job to NPS
7. User receives print confirmation

**Error Handling for Print Failures:**
- Network connectivity issues with NPS
- Printer offline or error states
- Invalid ZPL generation
- **Fallback**: Always allow manual ZPL download if network printing fails

### Integration Points

**Dependencies:**
- **Phase 5 Label System**: Core label design and template management
- **Existing CT Assignment**: Current CT Number Modal functionality
- **Network Infrastructure**: NPS setup and Zebra printer network configuration
- **Admin Settings**: Printer configuration and template management

**Related Features:**
- **SB Kitting/Packing Integration**: "Seamless access to label printing from Kitting/Packing UI"
- **CT Generation**: Must work with all CT generation methods (FAI Master, Last Used, Random)
- **Duplicate CT Handling**: Print functionality must respect duplicate warnings and approvals

### Customer-Specific Requirements

**HP-Specific Label Requirements:**
- **Current Context**: "CT Numbers: 14-digit alphanumeric, ALL UPPERCASE, must be unique"
- **Customer Logo Integration**: HP labels may require specific logos/branding
- **Template Defaults**: Admin can designate "Default CT Label" for HP orders

**Future Lenovo Consideration:**
- **Deferred to Next Version**: "lenovo serial / CT work we will do in next version"
- **Different Formats**: "yes lenovo and HP have different CT Formats"
- Architecture must support customer-specific label templates

### Success Criteria

**User Experience:**
- After CT assignment, user can print labels within 10 seconds
- No separate navigation or workflows required
- Template and printer selection remembered for session
- Clear success/failure feedback for print jobs

**Technical Requirements:**
- Integration with existing CT assignment flow (no workflow disruption)
- Support for multiple label templates per customer/category
- Reliable network printing with fallback options
- Real-time ZPL generation with CT data

**Administrative Control:**
- Admin can configure default templates and printers
- Template management without developer involvement
- Printer status monitoring and configuration
- Print job tracking and history (future enhancement)

### Implementation Notes

**Immediate Priority Items:**
1. Basic "Print Labels" button in CT Assignment Modal
2. Simple template selection (even with one default template)
3. Printer selection from configured list
4. ZPL generation with CT data
5. Network printing via configured NPS URL

**Phase 2 Enhancements:**
1. Advanced template designer integration
2. Multiple template options per customer
3. Print preview functionality
4. Print job status and history
5. Bulk printing optimizations

**Configuration Requirements:**
- Environment variable for NPS URL must be configurable
- Admin interface for printer management
- Template-to-printer default associations
- Print settings per user role (future)

This immediate print functionality is critical for warehouse efficiency and was specifically requested as high priority during barcode scanner integration discussions.

## üîÑ Implementation Updates

### June 7, 2025 - Core Print Functionality Implemented

**Changes Made:**
1. **CT Modal Enhancement**: Modified `CTNumberModal.tsx` to include print section after successful CT save
   - Added print state management (showPrintSection, savedCTNumbers, selectedTemplate, etc.)
   - Print section appears after successful save instead of immediately closing modal
   - User can now select template, printer, and quantity for immediate printing

2. **Label Generation System**: Created `src/utils/labelGeneration.ts`
   - Three default label templates: Default (102x152mm), Compact (51x25mm), HP-specific (102x152mm)
   - **Metric System**: Updated all dimensions to use millimeters as requested by user
   - ZPL generation for Zebra printers with dynamic CT data integration
   - Labelary.com preview integration for label verification

3. **Printer Configuration**: Created `src/hooks/usePrinterConfig.ts`
   - Configurable printer management system with localStorage persistence
   - Default printers for SB and NP locations with IP addresses and models
   - Support for multiple printers with location-based filtering

4. **ZPL Templates**: Implemented three label layouts:
   - **Default CT Label**: Order info, part number, CT with QR code, customer details
   - **Compact CT Label**: Minimal design for small labels
   - **HP CT Label**: HP-specific branding with "Handle with Care - ESD Sensitive"

**Technical Decisions:**
- **Metric Measurements**: All label dimensions converted to millimeters (102x152mm vs 4"x6")
- **ZPL Generation**: Dynamic ZPL creation with order data integration
- **Fallback Strategy**: Always provides ZPL file download if network printing fails
- **Preview Integration**: Uses Labelary.com for real-time label preview

**Current Status:**
- ‚úÖ CT Modal print section functional
- ‚úÖ Label template system working
- ‚úÖ ZPL generation with dynamic data
- ‚úÖ Preview functionality via Labelary
- ‚úÖ File download fallback
- ‚è≥ Network printing (pending alternative NPS approach)

**Next Steps:**
1. Implement actual network printing based on user's alternative NPS approach
2. Add admin interface for printer and template management
3. Add print job status tracking and history
4. Integration testing with actual Zebra printers

**User Notes:**
- User mentioned alternative approach to NPS - network printing implementation kept flexible
- Metric system (mm) implemented as requested
- Print functionality triggers immediately after CT assignment save
