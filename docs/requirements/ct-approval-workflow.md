## Core Requirements

### CT Number Uniqueness & Duplicate Handling

**Fundamental Business Rule:**
- **CT numbers should ideally be unique forever**
- **14-digit ALPHANUMERIC, with ALL CHARACTERS STRICTLY UPPERCASE**
- **Historical Lookup**: Upon manual entry/scan, system performs immediate historical lookup
- **Zero Auto-Generation of Duplicates**: System will never auto-generate a known duplicate CT

### Duplicate Warning System

**Immediate Duplicate Detection:**
- **Real-time Lookup**: When CT is entered/scanned, immediate database check against all historical CT numbers
- **Comprehensive Warning Message**: If duplicate found, display vigorous warning:
  ```
  WARNING: CT Number '[CT_NUMBER]' is a duplicate. 
  Previously used for Order '[Original_Order_UID]', 
  Part '[Original_Part_Number]', 
  supplied to '[Original_Customer]' 
  on '[Original_Ship_Date]'
  ```
- **Visual Emphasis**: Warning must be prominent and impossible to miss
- **Blocking Behavior**: Duplicate CT cannot be committed without successful override/approval

### Permission-Based Approval Workflow

**Users WITHOUT Direct Override Permission:**
- **Approval Request Trigger**: If user attempts to proceed with duplicate CT, trigger approval request
- **In-App Notification**: Send in-app notification to Directors/Admins immediately
- **Email Notification**: Send email notification to Directors/Admins with duplicate details
- **Blocking State**: User cannot proceed until authorized approver approves within system
- **Request Details**: Include full context (original usage, current intended usage, user requesting, business justification field)

**Users WITH Direct Override Permission:**
- **Warning Display**: Show same warning message but with override option
- **Acknowledge and Proceed**: Button/checkbox: "Acknowledge and Proceed with Duplicate Use"
- **Mandatory Justification**: Require reason/justification text before proceeding
- **Immediate Logging**: Log override action immediately with full details

### Approval Request System

**Request Creation:**
- **Automatic Generation**: System automatically creates approval request when non-privileged user attempts duplicate use
- **Request Details**: 
  - Requesting User ID and name
  - Duplicate CT Number
  - Original usage details (order, part, customer, date)
  - Intended new usage (current order, part, customer)
  - Business justification (user-provided text field)
  - Request timestamp
  - Urgency level (normal/urgent)

**Notification System:**
- **In-App Notifications**: Real-time notifications for Directors/Admins
- **Email Notifications**: Email to all users with approval permissions
- **WhatsApp Integration**: Optional WhatsApp notification via N8N for urgent requests
- **Escalation**: If not approved within configured timeframe, escalate notifications

**Approval Interface:**
- **Dedicated Admin Section**: Approval requests visible in admin panel
- **Request Queue**: List all pending approval requests with key details
- **Detailed View**: Click to see full context and history
- **Decision Options**: Approve, Deny, Request More Information
- **Approval Justification**: Mandatory reason field for approval decision
- **Batch Operations**: Approve/deny multiple requests simultaneously

### Approval Decision Actions

**Approval Granted:**
- **Immediate Notification**: Notify requesting user immediately (in-app, email, optional WhatsApp)
- **CT Usage Permission**: Allow CT to be used in intended context
- **Audit Logging**: Log approval with approver, timestamp, justification
- **Time Limit**: Approval valid for limited time (e.g., 24 hours) for specific usage

**Approval Denied:**
- **Immediate Notification**: Notify requesting user with denial reason
- **Alternative Suggestions**: Suggest alternative CT generation methods
- **Block Usage**: Permanently block that specific duplicate usage
- **Audit Logging**: Log denial with approver, timestamp, justification

**Request for More Information:**
- **User Notification**: Request additional context from user
- **Extended Justification**: Allow user to provide more detailed business justification
- **Stakeholder Consultation**: Enable approver to consult with other stakeholders
- **Status Update**: Keep user informed of review progress

### Comprehensive Audit & Logging System

**Duplicate Usage Logging (All Cases):**
- **Warning Events**: Log every duplicate warning shown to users
- **Override Events**: Log all direct overrides with user, justification, timestamp
- **Approval Requests**: Log all approval requests with full context
- **Approval Decisions**: Log all approvals/denials with approver details
- **CT Usage**: Log final CT usage after approval/override

**Audit Data Requirements:**
- **Timestamp**: Precise date/time for all events
- **User Identification**: User ID, name, role for all actions
- **CT Number**: The duplicate CT number in question
- **Original Usage Context**: Where/when CT was originally used
- **New Usage Context**: Where/when CT is intended to be used
- **Justification Text**: Business reason for duplicate usage
- **Approver Details**: Who approved/denied and when
- **Decision Timeline**: Time from request to decision

**Audit Trail Accessibility:**
- **Admin Reports**: Generate comprehensive audit reports
